In this code, we fetched data from an API, created a DataFrame from the fetched data, and calculated the Super Trend indicator using the fetched data. The Super Trend indicator helps identify the direction of the current trend in the market. By analyzing the upper and lower bands of the Super Trend indicator, traders can make informed decisions about buying or selling assets.

The code begins by fetching the data, converting it into a DataFrame, and performing data preprocessing tasks like converting columns to float and indexing by datetime. It then calculates the ATR and Super Trend indicators based on specified parameters. Finally, it generates a candlestick chart using Plotly to visualize the market data and Super Trend bands.
